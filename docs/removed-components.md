# Removed Components (Reference)

Recent cleanup removed non-production pages and placeholders:
- Banking v2 (dialogs, tabs, reconciliation) – removed pending a future, fully implemented flow.
- Diagnostics (dashboard/performance testing panels and tests) – removed; align future diagnostics with network monitoring module.
- UI/UX screenshot artifacts and status reports – removed (not part of deployable app).

Implications:
- Links to the removed banking/diagnostics pages should be hidden or redirected until replacements land.
- If you see 404s for those routes, they are expected; add new pages under the appropriate modules when ready.***
