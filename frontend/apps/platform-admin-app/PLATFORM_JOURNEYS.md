# Platform Admin App – Primary Journeys

Use this as a QA/UX guide for the control-plane experience. All flows are platform-facing; ISP network/billing operations are out of scope (see `SCOPE.md`).

- **Access & Identity**: Login → Dashboard → Security & Access (users, roles/permissions, API keys, secrets, tokens) → Profile.
- **Tenant/Partner Governance**: Platform Admin → Tenants (directory, licensing) → Cross-Tenant Search → System.
- **Licensing & Entitlements**: Platform Admin → Licensing; Tenant Portal → Subscription/Usage.
- **Configuration**: Feature Flags → Integrations → Plugins/Marketplace → Webhooks → Notifications → OSS (NetBox).
- **Audit & Compliance**: Platform Admin → Audit; Notifications → History; Security permissions view.
- **Communications & Support**: Communications (campaigns/templates), Ticketing (for tenant/partner incidents).
- **Tenant Self-Service**: Tenant Portal (billing/subscription/usage/users/support/integrations/licenses).

Out-of-scope journeys (removed/blocked): ISP network/infra, subscriber/device ops, ISP billing/revenue/banking/sales, diagnostics, orchestration/workflows, partner revenue.\*\*\*
